// maintain a set of processed nodes 
// assign all nodes with distances values = infinity except source node (0)
// repeat these actions until all vertices are included 
// 1. pick min vertex value which is not already processed
// 2. include this selected node in processed set
// 3. update all the adjecent node distances.
// if new_distance < old_distance then update it otherwise skip it
